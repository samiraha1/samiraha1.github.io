<p>
  Hi! My name is Samirah, and I aim to earn a bachelor's 
  in Computer Information Systems at the University of South Carolina. 
  I enjoy learning about new topics and computers are one of them. 
  I've enjoyed going out of my comfort zone to engage in an activity I could have never
   seen myself doing 10 years ago, but have come to enjoy. My mission statement is to grow 
   within my major and career while also growing mentally and learning to handle challenging or demanding situations.
