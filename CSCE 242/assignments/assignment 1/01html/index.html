    <h1>&hearts; Jellyfish &hearts;</h1>
    <p>Jellyfish are some of my favorite marine animals because of how they just flow with the water. They have no brains, so they just move freely without thoughts, which is something I wish I could have. While many jellyfish do have venomous tentacles, lots of species don’t. Later, I will talk about the venomous ones, but for now, let's talk a little about the non-venomous jellyfish that you could even swim with.

        All jellyfish have stinging cells, but some possess ones too mild to affect humans. For example, moon jellyfish and cannon jelly. There’s a lake you can swim with jellyfish in called Jellyfish Lake in Palau, as well as others in Indonesia. Jellyfish are such fascinating animals, and their existence is so interesting.
